# Numerical Optimization Project

This MATLAB project explores several variants of Newton's methods for solving unconstrained optimization problems. In particular, it implements and compares:

- Modified Newton method with backtracking  
- Truncated Newton method using CG and PCG  
- Empirical analysis on well-known test functions from the literature
